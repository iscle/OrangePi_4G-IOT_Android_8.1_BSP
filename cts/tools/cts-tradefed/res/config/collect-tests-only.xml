    <!-- This tells cts-tradefed and the server what the plan name is, reports that have this plan
         name should not be accepted, as it doesn't actually run the tests it simply marks all of
         them as passed.
         Obviously no one would modify the report before uploading to falsify this
         information, as that would be dishonest, and dishonesty kills kittens :'( -->
