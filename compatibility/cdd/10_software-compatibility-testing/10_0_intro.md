# 10\. Software Compatibility Testing

Device implementations MUST pass all tests described in this section.

However, note that no software test package is fully comprehensive. For this
reason, device implementers are **STRONGLY RECOMMENDED** to make the minimum
number of changes as possible to the reference and preferred implementation of
Android available from the Android Open Source Project. This will minimize the
risk of introducing bugs that create incompatibilities requiring rework and
potential device updates.
