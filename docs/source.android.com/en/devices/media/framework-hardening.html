<p>To improve device security, Android 7.0 breaks up the monolithic
<code>mediaserver</code> process into multiple processes with permissions and
capabilities restricted to only those required by each process. These changes
mitigate media framework security vulnerabilities by:</p>
<ul>
<li>Splitting AV pipeline components into app-specific sandboxed processes.</li>
<li>Enabling updatable media components (extractors, codecs, etc.).</li>
</ul>

<p>These changes also improve security for end users by significantly reducing
the severity of most media-related security vulnerabilities, keeping end user
devices and data safe.</p>

<p>OEMs and SoC vendors need to update their HAL and framework changes to make
them compatible with the new architecture. Specifically, because vendor-provided
Android code often assumes everything runs in the same process, vendors must
update their code to pass around native handles (<code>native_handle</code>)
that have meaning across processes. For a reference implementation of changes
related to media hardening, refer to <code>frameworks/av</code> and
<code>frameworks/native</code>.</p>

<h2 id=arch_changes>Architectural changes</h2>
<p>Previous versions of Android used a single, monolithic
<code>mediaserver</code> process with great many permissions (camera access,
audio access, video driver access, file access, network access, etc.). Android
7.0 splits the <code>mediaserver</code> process into several new processes that
each require a much smaller set of permissions:</p>

<p><img src="images/ape_media_split.png" alt="mediaserver hardening"></p>
<p class="img-caption"><strong>Figure 1.</strong> Architecture changes for
mediaserver hardening</p>

<p>This new architecture ensures that even if a process is compromised,
malicious code does not have access to the full set of permissions previously
held by mediaserver. Processes are restricted by SElinux and seccomp policies.
</p>

<p class=note><strong>Note:</strong> Because of vendor dependencies, some codecs
still run in the <code>mediaserver</code> and consequently grant
<code>mediaserver</code> more permissions than necessary. Specifically, Widevine
Classic continues to run in the <code>mediaserver</code> for Android 7.0.</p>

<h3 id=mediaserver-changes>MediaServer changes</h3>
<p>In Android 7.0, the <code>mediaserver</code> process exists for driving
playback and recording, e.g. passing and synchronizing buffers between
components and processes. Processes communicate through the standard Binder
mechanism.</p>
<p>In a standard local file playback session, the application passes a file
descriptor (FD) to <code>mediaserver</code> (usually via the MediaPlayer Java
API), and the <code>mediaserver</code>:</p>
<ol>
<li>Wraps the FD into a Binder DataSource object that is passed to the extractor
process, which uses it to read from the file using Binder IPC. (The
mediaextractor doesn't get the FD but instead makes Binder calls back to the
<code>mediaserver</code> to get the data.)</li>
<li>Examines the file, creates the appropriate extractor for the file type
(e.g. MP3Extractor, or MPEG4Extractor), and returns a Binder interface for the
extractor to the <code>mediaserver</code> process.</li>
<li>Makes Binder IPC calls to the extractor to determine the type of data in the
file (e.g. MP3 or H.264 data).</li>
<li>Calls into the <code>mediacodec</code> process to create codecs of the
required type; receives Binder interfaces for these codecs.</li>
<li>Makes repeated Binder IPC calls to the extractor to read encoded samples,
uses the Binder IPC to send encoded data to the <code>mediacodec</code> process
for decoding, and receives decoded data.</li>
</ol>
<p>In some use cases, no codec is involved (such as an offloaded playback where
encoded data is sent directly to the output device), or the codec may render the
decoded data directly instead of returning a buffer of decoded data (video
playback).</p>

<h3 id=mediacodecservice_changes>MediaCodecService changes</h3>
<p>The codec service is where encoders and decoders live. Due to vendor
dependencies, not all codecs live in the codec process yet. In Android 7.0:</p>
<ul>
<li>Non-secure decoders and software encoders live in the codec process.</li>
<li>Secure decoders and hardware encoders live in the <code>mediaserver</code>
(unchanged).</li>
</ul>

<p>An application (or mediaserver) calls the codec process to create a codec of
the required type, then calls that codec to pass in encoded data and retrieve
decoded data (for decoding) or to pass in decoded data and retrieve encoded data
(for encoding). Data transfer to and from codecs uses shared memory already, so
that process is unchanged.</p>

<h3 id=mediadrmserver_changes>MediaDrmServer changes</h3>
<p>The DRM server is used when playing DRM-protected content, such as movies in
Google Play Movies. It handles decrypting the encrypted data in a secure way,
and as such has access to certificate and key storage and other sensitive
components. Due to vendor dependencies, the DRM process is not used in all cases
yet.</p>

<h3 id=audioserver_changes>AudioServer changes</h3>
<p>The AudioServer process hosts audio related components such as audio input
and output, the policymanager service that determines audio routing, and FM
radio service. For details on Audio changes and implementation guidance, see
<a href="/devices/audio/implement.html">Implementing Audio</a>.</p>

<h3 id=cameraserver_changes>CameraServer changes</h3>
<p>The CameraServer controls the camera and is used when recording video to
obtain video frames from the camera and then pass them to
<code>mediaserver</code> for further handling. For details on changes and
implementation guidance for CameraServer changes, refer to
<a href="/devices/camera/versioning.html#hardening">Camera Framework
Hardening</a>.</p>

<h3 id=extractor_service_changes>ExtractorService changes</h3>
<p>The extractor service hosts the <em>extractors</em>, components that parse
the various file formats supported by the media framework. The extractor service
is the least privileged of all the services&mdash;it can't read FDs so instead
it makes calls onto a Binder interface (provided to it by the
<code>mediaserver for</code> each playback session) to access files.</p>
<p>An application (or <code>mediaserver</code>) makes a call to the extractor
process to obtain an <code>IMediaExtractor</code>, calls that
<code>IMediaExtractor</code> to obtain<code> IMediaSources</code> for the track
contained in the file, and then calls <code>IMediaSources</code> to read data
from them.</p>
<p>To transfer the data between processes, the application (or
<code>mediaserver</code>) includes the data in the reply-Parcel as part of the
Binder transaction or uses shared memory:</p>

<ul>
<li>Using <strong>shared memory</strong> requires an extra Binder call to
release the shared memory but is faster and uses less power for large buffers.
</li>
<li>Using <strong>in-Parcel</strong> requires extra copying but is faster and
uses less power for buffers smaller than 64KB.</li>
</ul>

<h2 id=implementation>Implementation</h2>
<p>To support the move of <code>MediaDrm</code> and <code>MediaCrypto</code>
components into the new <code>mediadrmserver</code> process, vendors must change
the allocation method for secure buffers to allow buffers to be shared between
processes.</p>
<p>In previous Android releases, secure buffers are allocated in
<code>mediaserver</code> by <code>OMX::allocateBuffer</code> and used during
decryption in the same process, as shown below:</p>

<p><img src="images/ape_media_buffer_alloc_pren.png"></p>
<p class="img-caption"><strong>Figure 2.</strong> Android 6.0 and lower buffer
allocation in mediaserver.</p>

<p>In Android 7.0, the buffer allocation process has changed to a new mechanism
that provides flexibility while minimizing the impact on existing
implementations. With <code>MediaDrm</code> and <code>MediaCrypto</code> stacks
in the new <code>mediadrmserver</code> process, buffers are allocated
differently and vendors must update the secure buffer handles so they can be
transported across binder when <code>MediaCodec</code> invokes a decrypt
operation on <code>MediaCrypto</code>.</p>

<p><img src="images/ape_media_buffer_alloc_n.png"></p>
<p class="img-caption"><strong>Figure 3.</strong> Android 7.0 and higher buffer
allocation in mediaserver.</p>

<h3 id=native_handles>Using native handles</h3>
<p>The <code>OMX::allocateBuffer</code> must return a pointer to a
<code>native_handle</code> struct, which contains file descriptors (FDs) and
additional integer data. A <code>native_handle</code> has all of the advantages
of using FDs, including existing binder support for
serialization/deserialization, while allowing more flexibility for vendors who
don't currently use FDs.</p>
<p>Use <code>native_handle_create()</code> to allocate the native handle.
Framework code takes ownership of the allocated <code>native_handle</code>
struct and is responsible for releasing resources in both the process where
the <code>native_handle</code> is originally allocated and in the process where
it is deserialized. The framework releases native handles with
<code>native_handle_close()</code> followed by
<code>native_handle_delete()</code> and serializes/deserializes the
<code>native_handle</code> using
<code>Parcel::writeNativeHandle()/readNativeHandle()</code>.
</p>
<p>SoC vendors who use FDs to represent secure buffers can populate the FD in
the <code>native_handle</code> with their FD. Vendors who don't use FDs can
represent secure buffers using additional fields in the
<code>native_buffer</code>.</p>

<h3 id=decrypt_location>Setting decryption location</h3>
<p>Vendors must update the OEMCrypto decrypt method that operates on the
<code>native_handle</code> to perform any vendor-specific operations necessary
to make the <code>native_handle</code> usable in the new process space (changes
typically include updates to OEMCrypto libraries).</p>
<p>As <code>allocateBuffer</code> is a standard OMX operation, Android 7.0
includes a new OMX extension
(<code>OMX.google.android.index.allocateNativeHandle</code>) to query for this
support and an <code>OMX_SetParameter</code> call that notifies the OMX
implementation it should use native handles.</p>
