<p>Understanding the Android graphics system starts behind the scenes with
BufferQueue and the gralloc HAL.</p>

<p>The BufferQueue class is at the heart of everything graphical in Android. Its
role is simple: Connect something that generates buffers of graphical data (the
<em>producer</em>) to something that accepts the data for display or further
processing (the <em>consumer</em>). Nearly everything that moves buffers of
graphical data through the system relies on BufferQueue.</p>

<p>The gralloc memory allocator performs buffer allocations and is
implemented through a vendor-specific HAL interface (see
<code>hardware/libhardware/include/hardware/gralloc.h</code>). The
<code>alloc()</code> function takes expected arguments (width, height, pixel
format) as well as a set of usage flags (detailed below).</p>

<h2 id="BufferQueue">BufferQueue producers and consumers</h2>

<p>Basic usage is straightforward: The producer requests a free buffer
(<code>dequeueBuffer()</code>), specifying a set of characteristics including
width, height, pixel format, and usage flags. The producer populates the buffer
and returns it to the queue (<code>queueBuffer()</code>). Later, the consumer
acquires the buffer (<code>acquireBuffer()</code>) and makes use of the buffer
contents. When the consumer is done, it returns the buffer to the queue
(<code>releaseBuffer()</code>).</p>

<p>Recent Android devices support the <em>sync framework</em>, which enables the
system to do nifty things when combined with hardware components that can
manipulate graphics data asynchronously. For example, a producer can submit a
series of OpenGL ES drawing commands and then enqueue the output buffer before
rendering completes. The buffer is accompanied by a fence that signals when the
contents are ready. A second fence accompanies the buffer when it is returned
to the free list, so the consumer can release the buffer while the contents are
still in use. This approach improves latency and throughput as the buffers
move through the system.</p>

<p>Some characteristics of the queue, such as the maximum number of buffers it
can hold, are determined jointly by the producer and the consumer. However, the
BufferQueue is responsible for allocating buffers as it needs them. Buffers are
retained unless the characteristics change; for example, if the producer
requests buffers with a different size, old buffers are freed and new buffers
are allocated on demand.</p>

<p>Producers and consumers can live in different processes. Currently, the
consumer always creates and owns the data structure. In older versions of
Android, only the producer side was binderized (i.e. producer could be in a
remote process but consumer had to live in the process where the queue was
created). Android 4.4 and later releases moved toward a more general
implementation.</p>

<p>Buffer contents are never copied by BufferQueue (moving that much data around
would be very inefficient). Instead, buffers are always passed by handle.</p>

<h2 id="gralloc_HAL">gralloc HAL usage flags</h2>

<p>The gralloc allocator is not just another way to allocate memory on the
native heap; in some situations, the allocated memory may not be cache-coherent
or could be totally inaccessible from user space. The nature of the allocation
is determined by the usage flags, which include attributes such as:</p>

<ul>
<li>How often the memory will be accessed from software (CPU)</li>
<li>How often the memory will be accessed from hardware (GPU)</li>
<li>Whether the memory will be used as an OpenGL ES (GLES) texture</li>
<li>Whether the memory will be used by a video encoder</li>
</ul>

<p>For example, if your format specifies RGBA 8888 pixels, and you indicate the
buffer will be accessed from software (meaning your application will touch
pixels directly) then the allocator must create a buffer with 4 bytes per pixel
in R-G-B-A order. If instead, you say the buffer will be only accessed from
hardware and as a GLES texture, the allocator can do anything the GLES driver
wants&mdash;BGRA ordering, non-linear swizzled layouts, alternative color
formats, etc. Allowing the hardware to use its preferred format can improve
performance.</p>

<p>Some values cannot be combined on certain platforms. For example, the video
encoder flag may require YUV pixels, so adding software access and specifying
RGBA 8888 would fail.</p>

<p>The handle returned by the gralloc allocator can be passed between processes
through Binder.</p>

<h2 id=tracking>Tracking BufferQueue with systrace</h2>

<p>To really understand how graphics buffers move around, use systrace. The
system-level graphics code is well instrumented, as is much of the relevant app
framework code.</p>

<p>A full description of how to use systrace effectively would fill a rather
long document. Start by enabling the <code>gfx</code>, <code>view</code>, and
<code>sched</code> tags. You'll also see BufferQueues in the trace. If you've
used systrace before, you've probably seen them but maybe weren't sure what they
were. As an example, if you grab a trace while
<a href="https://github.com/google/grafika">Grafika's</a> "Play video
(SurfaceView)" is running, the row labeled <em>SurfaceView</em> tells you how
many buffers were queued up at any given time.</p>

<p>The value increments while the app is active&mdash;triggering the rendering
of frames by the MediaCodec decoder&mdash;and decrements while SurfaceFlinger is
doing work, consuming buffers. When showing video at 30fps, the queue's value
varies from 0 to 1 because the ~60fps display can easily keep up with the
source. (Notice also that SurfaceFlinger only wakes when there's work to
be done, not 60 times per second. The system tries very hard to avoid work and
will disable VSYNC entirely if nothing is updating the screen.)</p>

<p>If you switch to Grafika's "Play video (TextureView)" and grab a new trace,
you'll see a row labeled
com.android.grafika/com.android.grafika.PlayMovieActivity. This is the main UI
layer, which is just another BufferQueue. Because TextureView renders into the
UI layer (rather than a separate layer), you'll see all of the video-driven
updates here.</p>
