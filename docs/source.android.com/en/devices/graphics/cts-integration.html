<p>Android CTS release packages (available from
<a href="/compatibility/cts/downloads.html">Android Compatibility
Downloads</a>) include deqp tests and require a subset of these tests (known as
the <code>mustpass</code> list), to pass. For devices that do not support a
target API or extension, tests are skipped and reported as passing.</p>

<p>The <code>mustpass</code> list includes OpenGL ES 3.0, OpenGL ES
3.1, OpenGL ES 3.2, and the Android Extension Pack tests. <code>mustpass</code>
files can be found under the <code>android/cts</code> directory in the deqp
source tree. You can run deqp tests through the <code>cts-tradefed</code>
utility with the following command:</p>

<pre class="devsite-terminal devsite-click-to-copy">
cts-tradefed run cts --plan CTS-DEQP
</pre>

<h2 id=duplicating_runs_without_cts>Duplicating runs without CTS</h2>

<p>To replicate the CTS run, install the deqp APK of the CTS package and use the
following command:</p>

<pre class="devsite-terminal devsite-click-to-copy">
adb -d shell am start -n com.drawelements.deqp/android.app.NativeActivity -e \
cmdLine "deqp --deqp-case=dEQP-GLES3.some_group.* --deqp-gl-config-name=rgba8888d24s8 --deqp-log-filename=/sdcard/dEQP-Log.qpa
</pre>

<p>The important part is the <code>--deqp-gl-config-name=rgba8888d24s8</code>
argument, which requests the tests be run on an RGBA 8888 on-screen surface
with a 24-bit depth buffer and an 8-bit stencil buffer. Remember to set
the desired tests using the <code>--deqp-case</code> argument.</p>

<h2 id=mapping_of_the_cts_results>CTS results mapping</h2>

<p>In the Android CTS, a test case can end up in one of three states: passed,
failed, or not executed (the deqp has more result codes available). CTS
automatically maps deqp result codes to CTS results:</p>
<ul>
<li>A CTS pass can include <code>Pass</code>, <code>NotSupported</code>,
<code>QualityWarning</code>, and <code>CompatibilityWarning</code>.</li>
<li>A CTS failure can include <code>Fail</code>, <code>ResourceError</code>,
<code>Crash</code>, <code>Timeout</code>, and <code>InternalError</code>.</li>
</ul>
