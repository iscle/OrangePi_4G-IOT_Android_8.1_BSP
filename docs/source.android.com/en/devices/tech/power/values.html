<p>Device manufacturers must provide a component power profile in
<code>/frameworks/base/core/res/res/xml/power_profile.xml</code>.</p>

<p>To determine values for power profiles, use hardware that measures the power
being used by the device and perform the various operations for which
information is needed. Measure the power use during those operations and compute
the values (deriving differences from other baseline power uses as appropriate).
</p>

<p>As the goal of a power profile is to estimate battery drain appropriately,
power profile values are given in current (amps). The Android framework
multiplies the current by the time for which the subsystem was active and
computes the mAh value, which is then used to estimate the amount of battery
drained by the application/subsystem.</p>

<p>Devices with Bluetooth, modem, and Wi-Fi controllers running Android 7.0 and
higher can provide additional power values obtained from chipset data.</p>


<h2 id="multiple-cpus">Devices with heterogeneous CPUs</h2>

<p>The power profile for devices with CPU cores of heterogeneous architecture
must include the following additional fields:
<ul>
<li>Number of total CPUs for each cluster (expressed in cpu.clusters.cores).</li>
<li>CPU speeds supported by each cluster.</li>
<li>Active CPU power consumption for each cluster.</li>
</ul>

<p>To differentiate between active CPU power consumption and supported CPU
speeds for clusters, append the cluster number to the name of the array. Cluster
numbers are assigned in the order of CPU cores in the kernel device tree. For
example, in a heterogeneous architecture that has two (2) clusters with four (4)
cores:</p>
<ul>
<li>cluster0 consists of cpu0-3</li>
<li>cluster1 consists of cpu4-7</li>
</ul>
<p>The Android framework uses these CPU core numbers when it reads statistics
from the <code>sysfs</code> files in:
<code>/sys/devices/system/cpu/cpu&lt;number&gt;/cpufreq/stats</code>.

<p>Example of cluster CPUs and speeds:</p>

<pre class="devsite-click-to-copy">
&lt;array name="cpu.active.cluster0"&gt;
&lt;value&gt;200&lt;/value&gt;
&lt;value&gt;300&lt;/value&gt;
&lt;value&gt;400&lt;/value&gt;
&lt;/array&gt;
&lt;array name="cpu.speeds.cluster0"&gt;
&lt;value&gt;600000&lt;/value&gt;
&lt;value&gt;800000&lt;/value&gt;
&lt;value&gt;1200000&lt;/value&gt;
&lt;/array&gt;

&lt;array name="cpu.active.cluster1"&gt;
&lt;value&gt;400&lt;/value&gt;
&lt;value&gt;500&lt;/value&gt;
&lt;value&gt;600&lt;/value&gt;
&lt;/array&gt;
&lt;array name="cpu.speeds.cluster1"&gt;
&lt;value&gt;800000&lt;/value&gt;
&lt;value&gt;1200000&lt;/value&gt;
&lt;value&gt;1400000&lt;/value&gt;
&lt;/array&gt;

<h2 id="le-bt-scans">Low Energy (LE) and Bluetooth scans</h2>
<p>For devices running Android 7.0, the system collects data for Low Energy (LE)
scans and Bluetooth network traffic (such as RFCOMM and L2CAP) and associates
these activities with the initiating application. Bluetooth scans are associated
with the application that initiated the scan, but batch scans are not (and
are instead associated with the Bluetooth application). For an application
scanning for N milliseconds, the cost of the scan is N milliseconds of rx time
and N milliseconds of tx time; all leftover controller time is assigned to
network traffic or the Bluetooth application.</p>
