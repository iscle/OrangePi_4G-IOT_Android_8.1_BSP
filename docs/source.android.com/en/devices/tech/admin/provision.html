<p>This page describes the process for deploying devices to corporate users
using NFC or via cloud services (for a complete list of requirements, see
<a href="/devices/tech/admin/implement.html">Implementing Device
Administration</a>).</p>

<p>To get started, download the
<a href="https://github.com/googlesamples/android-NfcProvisioning">NfcProvisioning
APK</a>
and
<a href="https://github.com/googlesamples/android-DeviceOwner">Android-DeviceOwner
APK</a>.
</p>

<p class="caution"><strong>Caution:</strong> If provisioning has already
started, affected devices must be factory reset first.</p>

<h2 id=managed_provisioning>Managed provisioning</h2>

<p>Managed Provisioning is a framework UI flow to ensure users are adequately
informed of the implications of setting a device owner or managed profile. It is
designed to act as a setup wizard for managed profiles.</p>

<p class="note"><strong>Note:</strong> The device owner can be set only from an
unprovisioned device. If <code>Settings.Secure.USER_SETUP_COMPLETE</code> has
ever been set, the device is considered provisioned and the device owner cannot
be set.</p>

<p>Devices that enable default encryption offer a considerably simpler and
quicker device administration provisioning flow. The managed provisioning
component:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Encrypts the device</li>
  <li>Creates the managed profile</li>
  <li>Disables non-required applications</li>
  <li>Sets the enterprise mobility management (EMM) app as profile owner</li>
</ul>

<p>In turn, the EMM app:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Adds user accounts</li>
  <li>Enforces device compliance</li>
  <li>Enables any additional system applications</li>
</ul>

<p>In this flow, managed provisioning triggers device encryption. The framework
copies the EMM app into the managed profile as part of managed provisioning. The
instance of the EMM app inside of the managed profile gets a callback from the
framework when provisioning is done. The EMM can then add accounts and enforce
policies; it then calls <code>setProfileEnabled()</code>, which makes the
launcher icons visible.</p>

<h2 id=profile_owner_provisioning>Profile owner provisioning</h2>

<p>Profile owner provisioning assumes the user of the device (and not a company
IT department) oversees device management. To enable profile owner provisioning,
you must send an intent with appropriate extras. For an example, use the TestDPC
application
(<a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.afwsamples.testdpc&hl=en">Download
from Google Play</a> or <a href="https://github.com/googlesamples/android-testdpc/">Build
from GitHub</a>). Install TestDPC on the device, launch the app from the
launcher, then follow the app instructions. Provisioning is complete when badged
icons appear in the launcher drawer.</p>

<p>Mobile Device Management (MDM) applications trigger the creation of the
managed profile by sending an intent with action:
<a href="https://android.googlesource.com/platform/frameworks/base/+/master/core/java/android/app/admin/DevicePolicyManager.java">DevicePolicyManager.ACTION_PROVISION_MANAGED_PROFILE</a>
. Below is a sample intent that triggers the creation of the managed profile
and sets the DeviceAdminSample as the profile owner:</p>

<pre class="devsite-click-to-copy">
<code class="devsite-terminal">adb shell am start -a android.app.action.PROVISION_MANAGED_PROFILE \
          -c android.intent.category.DEFAULT \
	      -e wifiSsid $(printf '%q' \"WifiSSID\") \
          -e deviceAdminPackage "com.google.android.deviceadminsample" \
	      -e android.app.extra.deviceAdminPackageName $(printf '%q'
                        .DeviceAdminSample\$DeviceAdminSampleReceiver) \
              -e android.app.extra.DEFAULT_MANAGED_PROFILE_NAME "My Organisation"</code>
</pre>

<h2 id=device_owner_provisioning_via_nfc>Device owner provisioning</h2>
<p>Use one of the following methods to set up device owner (DO)
provisioning.</p>

<h3 id=do_provision_nfc>Provisioning via NFC</h3>
<p>DO provisioning via NFC is similar to the profile owner method but requires
more bootstrapping. To use this method,
<a href="http://developer.android.com/guide/topics/connectivity/nfc/nfc.html">NFC
bump</a> the device during the initial setup step (i.e., first page of the setup
wizard). This low-touch flow configures Wi-Fi, installs the DPC, and sets the
DPC as device owner.</p>

<p>A typical NFC bundle includes the following:</p>

<pre class="devsite-click-to-copy">
                EXTRA_PROVISIONING_DEVICE_ADMIN_PACKAGE_NAME
                EXTRA_PROVISIONING_DEVICE_ADMIN_PACKAGE_LOCATION
                EXTRA_PROVISIONING_DEVICE_ADMIN_PACKAGE_CHECKSUM
                EXTRA_PROVISIONING_WIFI_SSID
                EXTRA_PROVISIONING_WIFI_SECURITY_TYPE
</pre>

<p>Devices must have NFC configured to accept the managed provisioning
mimetype from the setup experience:</p>

<pre class="devsite-click-to-copy">
/packages/apps/Nfc/res/values/provisioning.xml
</pre>
<pre class="devsite-click-to-copy">
      &lt;bool name="enable_nfc_provisioning"&gt;true&lt;/bool&gt;
      &lt;item&gt;application/com.android.managedprovisioning&lt;/item&gt;
</pre>

<h3 id=do_provision_cs>Provisioning via Cloud Services</h3>
<p>Device owner provisioning via cloud services is another method through which
a device can be provisioned in device owner mode during out-of-the-box setup.
The device can collect credentials (or tokens) and use them to perform a lookup
to a cloud service, which can then be used to initiate the device owner
provisioning process.</p>

<h2 id=emm_benefits>EMM benefits</h2>

<p>An enterprise mobility management (EMM) app can help by conducting the
following tasks:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Provision managed profile</li>
  <li>Apply security policies
  <ul>
    <li>Set password complexity</li>
    <li>Lockdowns: disable screenshots, sharing from managed profile, etc.</li>
  </ul></li>
  <li>Configure enterprise connectivity
  <ul>
    <li>Use WifiEnterpriseConfig to configure corporate Wi-Fi</li>
    <li>Configure VPN on the device</li>
    <li>Use <code>DPM.setApplicationRestrictions()</code> to configure corporate
    VPN</li>
  </ul></li>
  <li>Enable corporate app Single Sign-On (SSO)
  <ul>
    <li>Install desired corporate apps
    <li>Use <code>DPM.installKeyPair()</code> to silently install corp client
    certs</li>
    <li>Use <code>DPM.setApplicationRestrictions()</code> to configure
    hostnames, cert alias’ of corporate apps</li>
  </ul></li>
</ul>

<p>Managed provisioning is just one part of the EMM end-to-end workflow, with
the end goal of making corporate data accessible to apps in the managed
profile. For testing guidance, see
<a href="/devices/tech/admin/testing-setup.html">Setting up Device
Testing</a>.</p>

<h2 id=automate>Automated provisioning testing</h2>
<p>To automate the testing of enterprise provisioning processes, use
the Android for Work (AfW) Test Harness. For details, see
<a href="/devices/tech/admin/testing-provision.html">Testing Device
Provisioning</a>.</p>
