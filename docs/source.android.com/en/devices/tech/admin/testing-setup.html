<p>To ensure minimal support for managed profiles, OEM devices must contain the
following essential elements:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Profile owner (as described in
  <a href="https://developer.android.com/training/enterprise/app-compatibility.html">Ensuring
  Compatibility with Managed Profiles</a>)</li>
  <li>Device owner</li>
  </ul>

<p>For a complete list of requirements, see
<a href="/devices/tech/admin/implement.html">Implementing Device
Administration</a>.</p>

<p>To test device administration features, device owners can use the TestDPC
application (described below); consider also working directly with other
enterprise mobility management (EMM) providers.</p>

<h2 id=set_up_the_device_owner_for_testing>Set up device owner for testing</h2>
<p>Use the following instructions to set up a device owner testing environment.</p>

<ol>
  <li>Set up the device:
  <ol>
  <li style="list-style-type: lower-alpha">Factory reset the target device.</li>
  <li style="list-style-type: lower-alpha">Ensure you do not add any user accounts
  (e.g. those used to log into online services) to the device.
  This can be checked in <em>Settings->Accounts</em>.</li>
  </ol></li>
  <li>Set up the testing application using one of the following methods:
  <ul>
  <li><a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.afwsamples.testdpc&hl=en">Download
  the TestDPC application</a> (available from Google Play).</li>
  <li><a href="https://github.com/googlesamples/android-testdpc/">Build
  the TestDPC application</a> (available from github.com).</li>
  </ul>
  </li>
  <li>Set the TestDPC app as the device owner using the following command:<br>
<pre class="devsite-terminal devsite-click-to-copy">
adb shell dpm set-device-owner "com.afwsamples.testdpc/.DeviceAdminReceiver"
</pre>
  </li>
  <li>Go through device owner setup on the device (encrypt, select Wi-Fi, etc.)</li>
</ol>

<h2 id=verify_the_device_owner_was_correctly_setup>Verify device owner setup</h2>
<p>To verify the device owner was correctly setup, go to <em>Settings >
Security > Device Administrators</em> and confirm TestDPC is in the
list. Verify it cannot be disabled (this signifies it is a device owner).</p>

<h2 id=automate>Automated provisioning testing</h2>
<p>To automate the testing of enterprise provisioning processes, use
the Android for Work (AfW) Test Harness. For details, see
<a href="/devices/tech/admin/testing-provision.html">Testing Device
Provisioning</a>.</p>

<h2 id="troubleshooting">Bug reports and logs</h2>
<p>In Android 7.0, device owner Device Policy Client (DPCs) can get bug reports
and view logs for enterprise processes on a managed device.</p>

<p>To trigger a bug report (i.e., the equivalent data collected by <code>adb
bugreport</code> containing dumpsys, dumpstate, and logcat data), use
<code>DevicePolicyController.requestBugReport</code>. After the bug report is
collected, the user is prompted to give consent to send the bug report data.
Results are received by
<code>DeviceAdminReceiver.onBugreport[Failed|Shared|SharingDeclined]</code>. For
details on bug report contents, see
<a href="/source/read-bug-reports.html">Reading Bug Reports</a>.

<p>In addition, device owner DPCs can also collect logs related to actions a
user has taken on a managed device. Enterprise process logging is required for
all devices that report device_admin and enabled by a new log security buffer
readable only by the system server (i.e., <code>adb logcat -b security</code>
cannot read the buffer). ActivityManager service and Keyguard components log the
following events to the security buffer:</p>

<ul>
<li>Application processes starting</li>
<li>Keyguard actions (e.g., unlock failure and success)</li>
<li><code>adb</code> commands issued to the device</li>
</ul>

<p>To optionally retain logs across reboots (not cold boot) and make these logs
available to device owner DPCs, a device must have a kernel with
<code>pstore</code> and <code>pmsg</code> enabled, and DRAM powered and
refreshed through all stages of reboot to avoid corruption to the logs retained
in memory. To enable support, use the
<code>config_supportPreRebootSecurityLogs</code> setting in
<code>frameworks/base/core/res/res/values/config.xml</code>.</p>
