<p>
This document outlines the changes made to the telephony-related parts of the
Android framework in the 7.0 release to support enterprise use cases. This
document is targeted at manufacturers and focuses entirely on framework-related
telephony changes. In addition, this document outlines the changes that OEMs
will need to make to their preloaded applications that handle telephony-related
functions.
</p>

<p>
Android 7.0 introduces several new features to support enterprise telephony use
cases, in particular:
</p>

<ul>
<li>Cross profile contact search - Allows applications in the personal profile
to search for contacts that are supplied by the managed profile contacts
provider, which can be backed by any datastore, for example local to the device
or perhaps within an enterprise directory
<li>Cross profile contact badging - Allows work contacts to be clearly
distinguished from personal contacts
<li>Making Connection Service managed profile aware - Allows applications within
the Managed Profile to offer telephony features, such as to provide a separate
work dialer and work ConnectionService</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="examples-and-source">Examples and source</h2>

<p>
The Android Open Source Project (AOSP) implementations of Dialer, Contacts, and
Messaging apps have integrated the cross profile contact search  and badging
capability.
</p>

<p>
Examples:
</p><ul>
<li><strong>Adding badge to work contacts</strong>: see
<code>packages/apps/ContactsCommon</code> <em>f3eb5a207bfe0ff3b4ed2350ae5865ed8bc59798</em>
<li><strong>Cross profile search</strong>: see <code>packages/apps/ContactsCommon</code> <em>cd0b29ddbf3648e48f048196c62245d545bc6122</em></li>
</ul>

<h2 id="implementation">Implementation</h2>

<p>
Device implementers must implement cross-profile, search, lookup and badging
for contacts in their Dialer Contacts and SMS/MMS Messaging apps.</p>

<h3 id="cross-profile-contact-search">Cross-profile contact search</h3>

<p>
Cross profile contact search should be implemented using the Enterprise Contacts
API (<code>ContactsContract.Contacts.ENTERPRISE_CONTENT_FILTER_URI</code> etc.)
see <a
href="http://developer.android.com/preview/features/afw.html#contacts">http://developer.android.com/preview/features/afw.html#contacts</a>
</p>

<h3 id="work-profile-contact-badging">Work profile contact badging</h3>

<p>
Work profile contact badging can be implemented by checking
<code>ContactsContract.Directory.isEntepriseDirectoryId() </code>if available or
<a
href="http://developer.android.com/reference/android/provider/ContactsContract.Contacts.html#isEnterpriseContactId(long)">http://developer.android.com/reference/android/provider/ContactsContract.Contacts.html#isEnterpriseContactId(long)</a>
<code> </code>
</p>

<h3 id="managed-profile-aware-connectionservice">Managed Profile Aware
ConnectionService</h3>

<p>
Manufacturers should not need to modify the framework code to support this
functionality, but should be aware of it’s impact on the Telecomm service and
other telephony features.
</p>

<h2 id="validation">Validation</h2>

<p>
The cross profile contact search and badging feature can be validated by:
</p>

<ol>
<li>Setting up a managed profile on a test device using <a
href="https://github.com/googlesamples/android-testdpc">TestDPC</a>.
<li>Enabling cross profile contact search.
<li>Adding a local work contact within the managed profile.
<li>Searching for that contact within the system Dialer Contacts and SMS/MMS
Messaging Apps within the personal profile, checking that this contact is found
and it is correctly badged.</li>
</ol>

<p>
CTS tests have been added to ensure the underlying cross profile contact search
API has been implemented in
<code>com/android/cts/managedprofile/ContactsTest.java</code>.
