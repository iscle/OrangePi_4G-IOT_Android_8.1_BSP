<p>Android 7.0 moves functionality related to call notifications from the
Telecom system service in the Android platform to the Dialer application.
Previously, the responsibility for displaying call-related notifications was
split between Telecom and the default Dialer app, creating inconsistencies in
behavior. In Android 7.0, the Dialer assumes all responsibility for handling
call notifications.</p>

<h2 id=android_6>Behavior in Android 6.x and earlier</h2>
<p>In earlier Android releases, Telecom and Dialer split responsibilities as
described below:</p>

<table>
<tr>
<th>Functionality</th>
<th>Done by Telecom</th>
<th>Done by Dialer</th>
</tr>

<tr>
<td>Incoming call notification</td>
<td>Yes (ringing, vibrate)</td>
<td>Yes (notification display, caller ID)</td>
</tr>

<tr>
<td>Send to voicemail</td>
<td>Yes</td>
<td>No</td>
</tr>

<tr>
<td>Custom ringtone</td>
<td>Yes</td>
<td>No</td>
</tr>

<tr>
<td>Missed call notifications</td>
<td>Yes</td>
<td>No</td>
</tr>

<tr>
<td>Message Waiting Indicator (call voicemail)</td>
<td>Yes (telephony)</td>
<td>No</td>
</tr>

<tr>
<td>Visual voicemail notifications</td>
<td>No</td>
<td>Yes</td>
</tr>

</tbody>
</table>

<p>Examples of inconsistent behavior caused by this responsibility split
included:</p>
<ul>
<li>Telecom was responsible for starting the ringer/vibrator, but the dialer was
responsible for displaying the incoming call notification. If the dialer is slow
to startup, this can result in ringing starting several seconds before the
incoming call notification is displayed.</li>
<li>Telecom was responsible for displaying missed call notifications. As
proprietary features (such as Google caller ID) do not work on these
notifications, this could result in inconsistencies between Telecom
notifications and Dialer UI (such as the call log).</li>
</ul>

<h2 id=android_7>Behavior in Android 7.0 and later</h2>
<p>The Android Open Source Project (AOSP) Dialer implements the new
functionality. For details, refer to the following documentation:</p>

</ul>

<h2 id=implement>Implementation</h2>
<p>Device implementers may need to update Telecom/Telephony components that
expose APIs available for use by by the default Dialer.</p>
