    /**
     * Creates a prepared model for execution.
     *
     * prepareModel is used to make any necessary transformations or alternative
     * representations to a model for execution, possiblly including
     * transformations on the constant data, optimization on the model's graph,
     * or compilation into the device's native binary format. The model itself
     * is not changed.
     *
     * The model is prepared asynchronously with respect to the caller. The
     * prepareModel function must verify the inputs to the prepareModel function
     * are correct. If there is an error, prepareModel must immediately invoke
     * the callback with the appropriate ErrorStatus value and nullptr for the
     * IPreparedModel, then return with the same ErrorStatus. If the inputs to
     * the prepareModel function are valid and there is no error, prepareModel
     * must launch an asynchronous task to prepare the model in the background,
     * and immediately return from prepareModel with ErrorStatus::NONE. If the
     * asynchronous task fails to launch, prepareModel must immediately invoke
     * the callback with ErrorStatus::GENERAL_FAILURE and nullptr for the
     * IPreparedModel, then return with ErrorStatus::GENERAL_FAILURE.
     *
     * When the asynchronous task has finished preparing the model, it must
     * immediately invoke the callback function provided as an input to
     * prepareModel. If the model was prepared successfully, the callback object
     * must be invoked with an error status of ErrorStatus::NONE and the
     * produced IPreparedModel object. If an error occurred preparing the model,
     * the callback object must be invoked with the appropriate ErrorStatus
     * value and nullptr for the IPreparedModel.
     *
     * The only information that may be unknown to the model at this stage is
     * the shape of the tensors, which may only be known at execution time. As
     * such, some driver services may return partially prepared models, where
     * the prepared model can only be finished when it is paired with a set of
     * inputs to the model. Note that the same prepared model object can be
     * used with different shapes of inputs on different (possibly concurrent)
     * executions.
     *
     * Multiple threads can call prepareModel on the same model concurrently.
     *
     * @param model The model to be prepared for execution.
     * @param callback A callback object used to return the error status of
     *                 preparing the model for execution and the prepared model
     *                 if successful, nullptr otherwise. The callback object's
     *                 notify function must be called exactly once, even if the
     *                 model could not be prepared.
     * @return status Error status of launching a task which prepares the model
     *                in the background; must be:
     *                - NONE if preparation task is successfully launched
