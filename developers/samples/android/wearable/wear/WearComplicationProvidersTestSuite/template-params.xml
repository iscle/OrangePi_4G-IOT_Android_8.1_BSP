             (e.g. services, basic styles and theming, sync adapters)

             (e.g. performance optimizations, custom views, bluetooth)

             Expert is reserved for highly technical or specialized content, and should
             be used sparingly. (e.g. VPN clients, SELinux, custom instrumentation runners) -->

        <intro>

Steps for trying out the sample:
* Compile and install the wearable app onto your Wear device or emulator (for Wear scenario).

* This sample does not have a main Activity (just Services that provide the complication data).
Therefore, you may see an error next to the 'Run' button. To fix, click on the
"Wearable" dropdown next to the 'Run' button and select 'Edit Configurations'. Under the
'Launch Options', change the 'Launch' field from 'Default APK' to 'Nothing' and save.

This sample provides dummy data for testing the complications UI in your watch face. After
selecting a type from your watch face configuration Activity, you can tap on the complications to
see more options.

The Wear app demonstrates the use of [ComplicationData][1], [ComplicationManager][2],
[ComplicationProviderService][3], [ComplicationText][4], and [ProviderUpdateRequester][5].
