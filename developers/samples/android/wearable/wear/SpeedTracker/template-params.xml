This sample uses the FusedLocation APIs of Google Play Services
to gather location and speed. The sample provides a simple screen that shows the
current speed of the device on the watch. User can set a speed
limit and if the speed approaches that limit, it changes the
color to yellow and if it exceeds the limit, it turns red. User
can also enable recording of coordinates and when it pairs back
with the phone, this data will be synced with the phone
component of the app and user can see a track made of those
coordinates on a map on the phone.

             (e.g. performance optimizations, custom views, bluetooth)

             Expert is reserved for highly technical or specialized content, and should
             be used sparingly. (e.g. VPN clients, SELinux, custom instrumentation runners) -->

        <description>
            Sample demonstrates recording location and speed with a Wear device in mind. Location is
            retrieved via FusedLocatinProvider which retrieves coordinates from the phone or Wear
            depending on whether the phone is disconnected or not and whether the Wear device has a
            GPS chip.

        <intro>
<![CDATA[

Steps for trying out this sample:
* Compile and install the mobile app onto your mobile device or emulator.
* Compile and install the wearable app onto your Wear device or emulator.
(**Note:** wearable apps are not automatically pushed from your mobile device
unless you build a production release, see [here][1] for more info).

Sample demonstrates retrieving location and speed samples on Wear using the FusedLocationProvider.
It also passes GPS location information back to the mobile device via the Data Layer to be rendered
on a Map Fragment.
