Getting Started
---------------

This project demonstrates Google Sign-in. You will need to follow the setup instructions for
integrating Google Sign-in into an Android app at the link below. Remember to use the package name
com.example.android.wearable.wear.messaging when configuring your project and credentials, or
otherwise modify the sample appropriately if you want to use a different package name.

https://developers.google.com/identity/sign-in/android/start-integrating

After you finish setting up the ___google-services.json___ file for Google Sign-in, update the
___strings.xml___ file for the string value ___default\_web\_client\_id___ to the value for the
OAuth web client id created.

Features
---------------
The project demonstrates the following features:

- Chat list
- Contacts list
- Authentication with Google
- Sending a chat message
- Receiving a chat message
- Replying from a notification

Each feature is contained in it's own package:

- _com.example.android.wearable.wear.messaging.____chat___
    - Displays a conversation
    - Handles incoming messages from a mocked back end server.
    - Replies to messages from a notification
- _com.example.android.wearable.wear.messaging.____chatlist___
    - Displays all of the conversations you are involved in.
- _com.example.android.wearable.wear.messaging.____contacts___
    - Displays a list your contacts. In this sample, the contacts are mocked out. You will want to
    replace the backing datasource with your own contacts solution.
- _com.example.android.wearable.wear.messaging.____mock___
    - A local mock database.
- _com.example.android.wearable.wear.messaging.____model___
    - Objects that are displayed in the UI. These objects also act as entities and are persisted in
    the mock database.
