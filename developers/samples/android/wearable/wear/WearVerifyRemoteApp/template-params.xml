Steps for trying out the sample:
* Compile and install the mobile app onto your mobile device or emulator (for mobile
scenario).
* Compile and install the wearable app onto your Wear device or emulator (for Wear
scenario).

This sample demonstrate best practices for using PlayStoreAvailability and RemoteIntent to check
if the mobile version of your app exists from within your Standalone Wear 2.+ app and the other
way around. Scenarios:

1. Launch Wear standalone app to verify if the mobile version is installed. If it is not, you will
be able to open the Play Store on the remote mobile device from the app (if it has the Play Store).

2. Launch Mobile app to verify if the Wear version is installed. If it is not, you will
be able to open the Play Store on the remote Wear device from the app.

Although there are two apps (Mobile and Wear), each should be looked at as a separate, standalone
apps/experiences.
